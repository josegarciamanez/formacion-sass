# BEMSkel

BEMSkel is a a lightweight CSS framework written in BEM and SASS for building scalable component-based user interfaces. It includes commonly used UI components that I use on every web and React projects.

BEMSkel can be used as standalone CSS library or a starting point project. It's lightweight, minimal, and well-documented, leaving the creativity up to you.

- Minified production versions: [`dist/`](dist/)
- Unminified sources: [`src/`](src/)

## Features

- Written in BEM (Block, Modifier, Modifier) naming convention for classes to provide a
consistent and strict to easily extend the framework.
- Uses <a href="https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture">7-1 Architecture pattern</a> for maintainable and scalable SASS.
- Includes two methods of creating grids - CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Gulp Build System
- Designed to be scalable and easy to customize. Use it as a standalone library or use it a starting point to build your next application.

## Quick Start

```
$ git clone git@github.com:karloespiritu/bemskel.git

// customize the SASS files in /src
$ gulp watch

BEMSkel works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
